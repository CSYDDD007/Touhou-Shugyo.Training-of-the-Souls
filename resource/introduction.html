    <h1>PySTG Introduction</h1>
    <p>A very simple Python project that references to LuaSTG:)</p>
    <p>Actually, many functions in LuaSTG are not appeared in this project(My coding skill is still poor)</p>
    <p>However, at least it can support basic functions as being an Editor of STG game</p>
    <p><a href="https://luastg.com/" target="_blank">Website of LuaSTG, welcome to support it:)</a></p>
    <h2>The Menu Bar</h2>
    <p>Similar to LuaSTG, PySTG uses nodes to control the game logic
    <br>Such as enemy, bullet, boss, background, BGM
    <br>There are there options in [File]:
    <ul>
        <li>New: create an new project template</li>
        <li>Load: load an existed file(sba_dat)</li>
        <li>Save: save current project as sba_dat</li>
    </ul>
    <br>There are three options in [Help]:
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <li>Basic</li>
        <li>Advanced</li>
    </ul>
    There is an option in [Test]:
    <ul>
        <li>Test: execute the game based on Editor</li>
    </ul>
    While running the game, PySTG is locked for safety:)
    <br>Remember to place the (sba_dat) files in the 'mods' folder
    <br>The game reads the files from the 'mods' folder
    <br>(Actually, sba_dat files are saved as json format)
    </p>
